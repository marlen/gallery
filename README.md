gallery
=======

The Photo Gallery is from: http://adobe.github.com/Spry/demos/gallery/index.html

I wrote the makexml.rb to generate the photos.xml files 
  
and the pics.rb to generate the medium sized and thumb sized files.

I also found a bug in their  javascript and corrected it so you might want to get my version :)


Here is the file structure of this photo gallery:

* index.html

** galleries

*** folder_1  (I usually use a yyyy_mm_dd format)

**** med_size  

***** <JPG FILES> (resized pics generated by my program, pics.rb)

**** photos.xml (generated automatically by my program, makexml.rb) 
**** thumbs 

***** <GIF FILES> (resized pics generated by my program, pics.rb)


Install these libraries:

gem install xml-simple

gem install exifr
